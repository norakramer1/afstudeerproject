# CMD Afstudeerproject - YourEventGuide

For my graduation project i created a webapp that lets you make an account and log in to see cultural events based on your interests. In the second iteration i'm adding a way for you to interact with your 'friends'. This will be hardcoded so don't expect much.

For the project i used create-react-app, firebase, react-router-dom and react-dom.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can create an account, log in, and securely authenticate using Firebase Authentication.

- **Interest Management:** Users can add, edit, and remove their interests, which are then used to tailor event recommendations.

- **Personalized Events:** The app uses user interests to suggest events that match their preferences.
